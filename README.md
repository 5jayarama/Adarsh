## Maze generation algorithms


A NOTE to all who are interesting in this stuff: The idiots of moderators at StackExchange deleted some of my answers there where I wanted to just help people implementing some maze algorithms by pointing to this repository. These morons claimed I would "self promote". Self promoting what? Code with an MIT license or the documentation, animations etc.?

@StackExchange: Get a life.



This project provides Java implementations of more than 35 algorithms for generating so called "perfect mazes" (which are just spanning trees of undirected graphs).

The shown demo application can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/armin-reichert/mazes/releases). (Java 8 or later runtime needed.)

On the web, many maze generation implementations in all possible programming languages can be found. The popularity of these algorithms probably comes from the fact that mazes and their creation processes are visually appealing and not really difficult to implement. The most popular algorithm seems to be "recursive backtracking" which is random depth-first traversal of a graph. 

On the other hand, there are only a few websites where the whole spectrum of maze creation algorithms is investigated. One prominent example is [this blog](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap) where Jamis Buck presents the most popular maze algorithms together with Ruby/Javascript implementations. Reading his blog led myself to investigate this topic too.
